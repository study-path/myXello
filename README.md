## Purpose
In the words of Xello team
>I have a passion for coding beautiful, pixel-perfect CSS3/HTML5 layouts and intuitive interactions using hand-written Typescript, Angular, and other libraries and tools. I eager to master a solid understanding of how interactive experiences should look, feel, and function on a variety of devices. I try to think creatively, and can simplify 50 lines of code to 10. Continuous learning and growth are two of my core values, and I have an insatiable appetite for developing new skills. Above all, I hope that it will help me to fullfil Xello's mission of helping more than 5 million students plan their successful futures! :)
